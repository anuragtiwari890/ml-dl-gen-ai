    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction to Generative AI and the Rise of LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generative AI has taken off since 2022.\n",
    "- Key players: OpenAI (GPT-4), Anthropic (Claude 3), Meta (LLaMA), Google (Gemini), Amazon-backed initiatives.\n",
    "- Goal: Understand differences between AI, ML, DL, and Generative AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?\n",
    "\n",
    "- AI = Applications that perform tasks without human intervention.\n",
    "- Examples:\n",
    "  - Netflix: Recommendation system\n",
    "  - Self-driving cars\n",
    "- AI Engineers integrate models into scalable software like web/mobile apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. What is Machine Learning (ML)?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Subset of AI.\n",
    "- Provides statistical tools for:\n",
    "  - Data analysis\n",
    "  - Prediction & forecasting\n",
    "  - Visualization\n",
    "- Helps understand data and make it actionable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. What is Deep Learning (DL)?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Subset of ML.\n",
    "- Uses neural networks to mimic the human brain.\n",
    "- Became popular due to GPUs, open-source tools, etc.\n",
    "- Core techniques:\n",
    "  - CNN: Computer vision\n",
    "  - RNN/LSTM/GRU: Text/time series\n",
    "  - Transformers & BERT: Foundation for Generative AI\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. What is Generative AI?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Subset of Deep Learning.\n",
    "- Focus: Generate new content (text, images, videos).\n",
    "- Types of models:\n",
    "  - Discriminative (e.g., classifiers)\n",
    "  - Generative (e.g., text/image creators)\n",
    "- Generative models are trained on massive datasets to generate new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Discriminative vs Generative Models\n",
    "\n",
    "| Type           | Purpose                | Training Data     |\n",
    "|----------------|------------------------|--------------------|\n",
    "| Discriminative | Classification, etc.   | Labeled datasets   |\n",
    "| Generative     | Content creation       | Huge unlabeled data|\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Foundation Models (LLMs & LIMs)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Examples:\n",
    "  - OpenAI: GPT-4, GPT-5 (upcoming)\n",
    "  - Anthropic: Claude 3\n",
    "  - Meta: LLaMA 2/3\n",
    "  - Google: Gemini, Gemma\n",
    "- These are massive pre-trained models used across domains.\n",
    "- Known as: Foundation models or pre-trained models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Fine-Tuning Foundation Models\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use your own data to adapt models to your needs.\n",
    "- Techniques include:\n",
    "  - LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)\n",
    "- Enables domain-specific use without retraining from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. LangChain and LLM (Large Language Model) Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "- LangChain = Framework to connect LLMs to data/tools.\n",
    "- Enables:\n",
    "  - Chatbots\n",
    "  - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\n",
    "  - Business workflows with AI automation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10. Large Image Models (LIMs)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Like LLMs, but for image/video generation.\n",
    "- Companies like Stability AI lead this field.\n",
    "- Use cases: Text-to-image, video synthesis, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generative AI is reshaping app development and content creation.\n",
    "- The race is on to build the best foundation models.\n",
    "- Follow-up playlists cover:\n",
    "  - LangChain\n",
    "  - Open-source LLMs\n",
    "  - Fine-tuning and practical projects"

# LSTM & RNN Practical Implementation

This folder contains practical notebooks for implementing LSTM and RNN models on real-world datasets. Learn how to preprocess data, build models, and evaluate their performance.

## Environment Setup
- Python 3.11 is recommended
- Create and activate a virtual environment:
  ```bash
  brew install python@3.11
  python3.11 --version  # check version
  python3.11 -m venv rnn-env
  source rnn-env/bin/activate
  python --version  # check the version
  ```

## Topics Covered
- Data preprocessing for sequence models
- Building LSTM and RNN architectures
- Model training and evaluation

## How to Use
Open the notebooks in Jupyter or VS Code and follow the practical steps to implement and test LSTM/RNN models.

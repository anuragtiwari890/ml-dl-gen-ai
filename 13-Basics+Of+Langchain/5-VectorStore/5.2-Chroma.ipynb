    "# Vector Stores: Utilizing Chroma for Persistent Vector Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook explores **Chroma**, an AI-native open-source vector database designed for developer productivity. Chroma offers a convenient way to store, manage, and query vector embeddings, making it an excellent choice for building RAG applications and semantic search systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will demonstrate how to:\n",
    "* Build an in-memory Chroma vector database.\n",
    "* Query the database for similarity.\n",
    "* Persist the Chroma database to disk for later use.\n",
    "* Perform similarity searches with relevance scores.\n",
    "* Integrate Chroma as a LangChain `Retriever`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You Will Learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Chroma Basics**: What Chroma is and its role in AI applications.\n",
    "2.  **Building a Vector DB**: Loading, splitting, and embedding documents into Chroma using Ollama embeddings.\n",
    "3.  **In-Memory vs. Persistent Chroma**: Differentiating between temporary and disk-saved databases.\n",
    "4.  **Querying Chroma**: Performing similarity searches to retrieve relevant documents.\n",
    "5.  **Similarity Search with Scores**: Understanding how to get a relevance score along with retrieved documents.\n",
    "6.  **Chroma as a LangChain Retriever**: Integrating Chroma into the standard LangChain `Retriever` interface for streamlined RAG pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Chroma**: An open-source, in-memory by default (but can be persistent) vector database that stores embeddings, documents, and metadata.\n",
    "* **Vector Database**: A specialized database optimized for storing and querying high-dimensional vectors (embeddings), enabling fast similarity searches.\n",
    "* **`persist_directory`**: A parameter in Chroma that specifies a local path to save the database files, ensuring data persistence across sessions.\n",
    "* **`embedding_function`**: The callable (e.g., an `OllamaEmbeddings` instance) that Chroma uses internally to convert text into vector embeddings.\n",
    "* **Similarity Search**: Finding documents in the vector database that are semantically similar to a given query.\n",
    "* **Similarity Score**: A numerical value indicating the similarity between the query and a retrieved document. For cosine similarity (often default for embeddings), higher values indicate more similarity (e.g., 0 to 1). For L2 distance (Euclidean), lower values mean higher similarity. Chroma's default for `similarity_search_with_score` is cosine distance, where a lower score indicates higher similarity, ranging from 0 (identical) to 2 (opposite).\n",
    "* **Retriever**: A LangChain component that retrieves relevant documents based on a query, abstracting the underlying vector store logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites:\n",
    "Before running the code in this notebook, ensure you have:\n",
    "1.  **Ollama Installed and 'llama2' model pulled**: If you haven't already, run `ollama pull llama2` in your terminal, as `OllamaEmbeddings()` will use this model by default.\n",
    "2.  **Required Libraries Installed**:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    pip install langchain-chroma langchain-community langchain-text-splitters\n",
    "    ```"

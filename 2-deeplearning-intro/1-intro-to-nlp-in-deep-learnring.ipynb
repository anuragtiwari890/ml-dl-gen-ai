    "# 🧠 NLP in Deep Learning: Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📌 Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session, we begin transitioning from **traditional NLP with Machine Learning** to **NLP in Deep Learning**. This is a critical step toward understanding modern architectures like **RNNs, LSTMs, Transformers**, and eventually **LLMs** (Large Language Models) used in **Generative AI**.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## 💡 Recap: NLP with Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, we explored different techniques to convert raw **text data** into **numerical representations** using:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **One Hot Encoding**\n",
    "2. **Bag of Words**\n",
    "3. **TF-IDF**\n",
    "4. **Word2Vec**\n",
    "5. **Average Word2Vec**\n",
    "\n",
    "We applied these in real-world problems like:\n",
    "- **Sentiment Analysis**\n",
    "- **Text Classification**\n",

    "## 🧮 Transitioning to Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Deep Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional machine learning assumes tabular data, where:\n",
    "- The **order of features** doesn’t matter.\n",
    "- All inputs are processed **independently**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:  \n",
    "In house price prediction with ANN, features like size and number of rooms are **independent**, and reordering them doesn’t affect the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### But text is different...\n",
    "\n",
    "Text is a **sequential type of data**, where **order matters a lot**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔁 What is Sequential Data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequential data means that:\n",
    "- The **order of inputs affects meaning**.\n",
    "- We can't just shuffle or reorder them like in tabular data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📖 Real-World Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Text Generation**  \n",
    "   e.g., “This is an apple ____” → likely prediction: “juice”\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Chatbot Conversations**  \n",
    "   Context and order of previous messages shape the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Language Translation**  \n",
    "   Translating a sentence word-by-word without context fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Auto-suggestions**  \n",
    "   As in Gmail/LinkedIn — uses previous input to suggest next phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Sales Forecasting**  \n",
    "   Sales over time form a time series — another type of sequential data.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 🤔 Can We Use ANN for Sequential Data?\n",
    "\n",
    "> This is the central question posed at the end of the video:\n",
    "**\"Can we use a regular ANN to handle sequential data?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "While **ANNs** work great for **tabular data**, they fail to capture **temporal patterns** or **contextual relationships** in sequences.  \n",
    "➡️ This is where **RNNs and advanced architectures** come into play.\n",

    "## 🚀 Roadmap for NLP in Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "To build towards **Generative AI and LLMs**, here’s what we’ll learn next:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 🔄 **Simple RNN**  \n",
    "   Basic recurrent structure for processing sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ⏳ **LSTM / GRU**  \n",
    "   Overcome limitations of RNN (like vanishing gradients).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. 🔁 **Bidirectional RNN**  \n",
    "   Looks at input from both past and future context.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. 🔃 **Encoder-Decoder Architecture**  \n",
    "   Foundation of tasks like translation and summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. 🌟 **Self-Attention**  \n",
    "   Core mechanism that lets the model weigh importance of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. 🧠 **Transformers**  \n",
    "   Basis of most modern LLMs (e.g., GPT, BERT).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📈 Why Is This Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Foundational for building and understanding **LLMs**, **Generative AI**, and **Multi-Modal Models**.\n",
    "- Crucial knowledge for **AI interviews**, **industry projects**, and **advanced research**.\n",

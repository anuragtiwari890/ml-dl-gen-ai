    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we continue our journey in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** by exploring **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** ‚Äî a powerful technique to identify and classify real-world entities from text.\n",

    "### ‚ùì Why Do We Need Named Entity Recognition?\n",
    "\n",
    "While POS tagging helps identify **grammatical structure**, NER goes a step further by detecting **semantic meaning**‚Äîrecognizing which words refer to **people**, **locations**, **dates**, **organizations**, **money amounts**, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "NER is essential for:\n",
    "- üßç **Identifying key entities** in documents, such as names, places, and dates.\n",
    "- üîé **Improving information extraction** for applications like question answering, search engines, and chatbots.\n",
    "- üìä **Structuring unstructured text** for downstream analysis (e.g., converting free-form text into structured data).\n",
    "- üí¨ **Context-aware processing**‚Äîhelping models understand not just what a word is, but what it represents in the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "- Understand what Named Entity Recognition (NER) is and how it differs from POS tagging.\n",
    "- Learn how to perform NER using **NLTK‚Äôs `ne_chunk`** method.\n",
    "- Apply NER to real-world text (e.g., identifying names, locations, dates from a sentence).\n",
    "- Visualize named entities in a tree-based structure using NLTK‚Äôs built-in **graphical parser**.\n",
    "- Resolve common issues like missing NLTK resources (e.g., downloading `maxent_ne_chunker` and `words` corpora).\n",

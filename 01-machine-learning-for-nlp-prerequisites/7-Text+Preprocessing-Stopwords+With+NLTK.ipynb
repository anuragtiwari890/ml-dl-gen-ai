    "# üìå Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "In this notebook, we explored the concept of Stopwords in NLP using the NLTK library.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úîÔ∏è Stopwords are common words (e.g., 'the', 'is', 'in') that usually don't carry significant meaning.\n",
    "‚úîÔ∏è We used NLTK's stopword corpus to filter them out from our text.\n",
    "‚úîÔ∏è After removing stopwords, we applied:\n",
    "    - Stemming (Porter and Snowball Stemmer)\n",
    "    - Lemmatization (WordNet Lemmatizer)\n",
    "‚úîÔ∏è We also handled multilingual stopwords (German, French, Arabic).\n",
    "‚úîÔ∏è Finally, we saw how stopword removal helps reduce noise and improves performance for NLP tasks\n",
    "   like sentiment analysis or text classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "üìù Important:\n",
    "    - Customize stopword lists depending on the task (e.g., keep 'not' for sentiment analysis).\n",
    "    - Always lowercase text before removing stopwords or applying NLP transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next Steps ‚û°Ô∏è We'll explore POS (Part-of-Speech) Tagging to enhance lemmatization and understand\n",
    "sentence structure better.\n",

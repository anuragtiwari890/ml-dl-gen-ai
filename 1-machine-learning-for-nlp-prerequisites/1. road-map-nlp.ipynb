    "\n",
    "The instructor introduces the **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** series and outlines a **roadmap** for learning NLP in the context of machine learning and deep learning. He explains how traditional supervised machine learning works with features and labels, and then shifts focus to **text-based features**, which require special preprocessing techniques since models can't understand raw text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **roadmap to mastering NLP** is presented as a **pyramid**, starting from foundational skills to advanced methods:\n",

    "#### Step-by-step NLP Learning Path:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Learn Python** ‚Äì Basic programming knowledge is essential.  \n",
    "2. **Text Preprocessing Part 1** ‚Äì  \n",
    "   - Focus on cleaning the text: tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, removing stopwords, etc.  \n",
    "3. **Text Preprocessing Part 2** ‚Äì  \n",
    "   - Convert text to numerical vectors: Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF, n-grams.  \n",
    "4. **Text Preprocessing Part 3** ‚Äì  \n",
    "   - Advanced vectorization: Word2Vec, Average Word2Vec.  \n",
    "5. **Deep Learning for NLP** ‚Äì  \n",
    "   - Learn RNN, LSTM, GRU for handling sequences and text.  \n",
    "6. **Word Embeddings** ‚Äì  \n",
    "   - More contextual embeddings like custom-trained word embeddings.  \n",
    "7. **Transformers & BERT** ‚Äì  \n",
    "   - State-of-the-art models for high-accuracy NLP tasks.\n",

    "### üéØ Objective:  \n",
    "This video serves as the **starting point of a Natural Language Processing (NLP)** course focused on applying NLP techniques using both **machine learning and deep learning**. The instructor shares the **roadmap** for how learners should approach NLP step by step, and explains the importance of each phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìå Why NLP?  \n",
    "- NLP is one of the **most researched and rapidly growing** fields in AI and ML.  \n",
    "- It powers real-world applications like **spam filters, chatbots, virtual assistants (e.g., Alexa, Google Home)**, and more.  \n",
    "- Traditional ML models can't interpret raw text; NLP helps **convert human language into a machine-readable format** (vectors).\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîπ Base Level: Programming  \n",
    "- **Learn Python**  \n",
    "  Python is the primary programming language used in NLP due to its rich ecosystem of libraries.\n",

    "------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîπ Step 1: Text Preprocessing ‚Äì Part 1 (Cleaning the Text)  \n",
    "This step involves preparing raw text for analysis by:  \n",
    "- **Tokenization** ‚Äì Breaking text into words or sentences.  \n",
    "- **Lemmatization/Stemming** ‚Äì Reducing words to their root form.  \n",
    "- **Stopwords Removal** ‚Äì Removing commonly used words like ‚Äúthe‚Äù, ‚Äúis‚Äù, ‚Äúin‚Äù, which do not contribute much to meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "üìå **Goal:** Make the input cleaner and standardized for modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîπ Step 2: Text Preprocessing ‚Äì Part 2 (Vectorization)  \n",
    "Once text is cleaned, it needs to be **converted into numbers (vectors)**:  \n",
    "- **Bag of Words (BoW)**  \n",
    "- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**  \n",
    "- **Unigrams, Bigrams, etc.**\n",
    "\n",
    "üìå **Goal:** Numerically represent text while retaining some context or frequency of words.\n",

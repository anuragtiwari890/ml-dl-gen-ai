## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anuragtiwari890/ml-dl-gen-ai.git
   cd ml-dl-gen-ai
   ```
2. **Set up a virtual environment (recommended):**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv ml-env
   source ml-env/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # if available in the folder
   ```
3. **Open notebooks:**
   - Use Jupyter Notebook or VS Code to explore and run the notebooks in each topic folder.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements & Environment

- Python 3.8+ (some projects use 3.11)
- Jupyter Notebook or VS Code
- See each folder's `requirements.txt` for dependencies
- For projects using APIs (OpenAI, Llama, etc.), copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your API keys as needed
